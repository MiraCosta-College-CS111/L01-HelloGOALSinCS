# Lab 01 - Hello GOALS in CS!

_Learning Objective: demonstrate editing, running, and testing of GitHub Classroom lab_

### Welcome to your first in-class lab! :D
1. **Investigate the code**
  
    Open [Main.java](./Main.java) and look at the code. There is a lot of extra code for a
simple program, but today just notice that we have a `class` named `Main`, a method 
named `main` and a statement `System.out.println("Hello world.);`.


2. **Run the code**

   Running or executing your code will allow you to see how it currently works,
   <details>
      <summary>VS Code (CodeSpaces or Local)</summary>
      There are a number of ways to run a program in VS Code.
      
      * You can use the Run and Debug tool in the Activity Bar.
      * You can choose Run Java from the context menu in the program.
      * You can select the play button on the top right of the editor window.
      * You can choose Run Without Debugging from the Run menu.
   
   The output will appear in the terminal window.
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary>Intellij IDEA</summary>
      There are a number of ways to run a program in IntelliJ IDEA.

      * You can use the green play button at the top of the editor window.
      * You can choose Run option from the context menu in the program.
      * You can select the play button to the left of the class or main method in the editor.
      * You can choose Run from the Run menu.

   The output will appear in the Run window.   
   </details>


3. **Change the code**

   **_To complete this lab_**, edit the code so it says:

   ```
   Hello, GOALS in CS!
   ```

   Note, it must say the above **exactly** as shown. 


4. **Test the code**

   Built in tests can check your code to see if you have made the
   changes correctly. The way these tests are run depends on your
   IDE. <br><br>If your code passes the test, a green checkmark
   will appear. If you see a red X, click on the expected message and
   investigate the differences.
   <details>
      <summary>VS Code (CodeSpaces or Local)</summary>
      
      After running your code, a beaker will appear in your Activity Bar,
      this will give you access to the testing interface. Click the double
      arrow to run all the available tests. 
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary>Intellij IDEA</summary>
      
      Using the context menu of the root folder, select runn all tests. 
   </details>


5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until done**
6. **Commit and Push your code**

   1. Click on the Source Control icon (VS Code) or the Git icon (IDEA). 
   1. Click on the plus sign (VS Code) or the checkmark (IDEA) next to the files
      you wish to commit.
   2. Enter a meaningful commit message.
   3. Click the commit button and sync (VS Code) or select Commit and Push (IDEA). Committing and pushing can be done
   as two separate steps.


This is how our weekly in-class labs will usually flow.
