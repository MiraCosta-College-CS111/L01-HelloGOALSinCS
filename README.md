# Lab 01 - Hello GOALS in CS!

_Learning Objective: demonstrate editing, running, and testing of GitHub Classroom lab_

Welcome to your first in-class lab! :D

**_First start by running the given code_**, this is the most basic version of any running Java program.

The prep modules will go more into each part, but for now get used to typing this out if you're ever asked to in class.

**_To complete this lab_**, edit the code so it says:

```
Hello, GOALS in CS!
```

Note, it must say the above **exactly** as shown. When you think you got it, click the check mark âœ“ in the left menu then select `run tests`

If the tests fail, go back and fix the bugs in your code, then re-run the tests. Do this until you pass all tests.

This is how our weekly in-class labs will usually flow.
